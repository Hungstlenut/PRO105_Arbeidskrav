							Neo believes that Morpheus, an elusive figure considered to be the
							most dangerous man alive, can answer his question -- What is the
							Matrix? Neo is contacted by Trinity, a beautiful stranger who
							leads him into an underworld where he meets Morpheus. They fight a
							brutal battle for their lives against a cadre of viciously
							intelligent secret agents. It is a truth that could cost Neo
							something more precious than his life. Neo discovers his ability
							to stop bullets...

							Freedom fighters Neo, Trinity and Morpheus continue to lead the
							revolt against the Machine Army, unleashing their arsenal of
							extraordinary skills and weaponry against the systematic forces of
							repression and exploitation. The movie ends with Neo becoming The One and using those powers to
							embrace free will. However, The Architect reveals that the mantle
							of The One was never about Neo having free will, but was simply
							another tool used to force Neo into a predestined role he was
							meant to fulfill.

							The majority of the planet's population remains in a state of suspended virtual reality. 
              The few humans who are cognizant of the grim realities of the world
							desperately try to hold off their mechanical enemies long enough
							for Neo to escape and save the day, but things turn disastrous
							when all-powerful computer program Agent Smith arrives in the
							flesh. Neo dies along with Smith bringing his reign to an end. At
							Zion, as promised by the Machine Leader, the sentinels are called
							back and Zion is allowed to survive.
